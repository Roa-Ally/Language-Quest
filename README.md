# Language Quest

A narrative-driven 2D adventure game that explores the power of language, memory, and cultural preservation through the lens of a young protagonist's journey into a mystical forest.

## Game Overview

The game follows a young woman who discovers a weathered book in her late grandmother's cabin. This book contains fragments of an ancient story written in both Spanish and an older, nearly forgotten language. The story tells of Chullachaqui, a forest guardian spirit with one twisted foot, and a forest where words hold magical power.

## The Story

The protagonist's childhood forest is dying, not from natural causes, but from forgetting. The world tree, buried deep in the ancient wood, is withering as the forest's language fades from memory. The player must journey through forgotten paths, recover lost story fragments, and relive the tale of Chullachaqui to restore what was broken.

## Core Gameplay Features
